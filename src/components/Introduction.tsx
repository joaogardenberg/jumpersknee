      <h1>Jumper's knee</h1>
      <p>
        Jumper's knee, also known as jumper's knee or patellar tendinopathy, is
        an overuse injury of the patellar tendon that is common in runners and
        other athletes. Relatively sufficient rest, but especially a gradual
        increase in training, is essential to alleviate the symptoms.
